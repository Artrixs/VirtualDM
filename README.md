A simulation of the ACEI interlocking in use on italian railways

The aim of this project is to simulate the interlocking system of the italian railways.

To do so I am creating a new game engine to simulate the railway infrastructure and the movement of trains.
On top of the engine sits the actual interlocking simulator allowing the player to see the presence of trains and to interact with signals and switche.
